# Blackjack

This is a remake of the blackjack program I created in C++ but with go.
The goal of this remake is to add a player that plays randomly and records the
results in hopes of learning the best possible moves.

## To Do

- Refactor exported and unexported properties
- Reorganize the base player
- Use player status in more clear way
- Reorganize the table to be more clear
