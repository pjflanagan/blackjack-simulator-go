# Blackjack

This is a remake of the blackjack program I created in C++ but with go.
The goal of this remake is to add a player that plays randomly and records the
results in hopes of learning the best possible moves.

## To Do

- [ ] Validation for a player's move, right now they can split and double down whenever
- [ ] Better print statement organization, print a player's sum like: TODO: still printing soft 21 (should just say 21) "Rainman has soft 16."
- [ ] Refactor exported and unexported properties
- [ ] Reorganize the base player, use player status in more clear way
- [ ] Reorganize the table to be more clear
