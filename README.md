# Blackjack

This is a remake of the blackjack program I created in C++ but with go.
The goal of this remake is to add a player that plays randomly and records the
results in hopes of learning the best possible moves.

## To Do

- [ ] Refactor exported and unexported properties
- [ ] Terminal colors and line stuff
